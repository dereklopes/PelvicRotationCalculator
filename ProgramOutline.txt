1. JavaFX program (for multi-platform)
2. User selects one of the situations (found in the paper)
    2a. Gives known measurements in mm/cm (identify knowns/unknowns from paper)
    2b. Program calculates unknowns
    2c. Unknowns are presented in a table
3. Host somewhere and give download link

(Optional) 
- Configurable units for measurements
- Save and load calculations


Calculations:
1. Focal film distance (ex. 72 in) - UK*
2. Lateral distance S2/MFH to film (labeled as 'b') (ex. 5 in) - UK*
3. Calculate lateral source-object (labeled as 'a') (subtract 2 from 1)
4. Lateral S2 to MFH from film (ex. 100 mm) - UK*
5. Calculate lateral magnifiaction factor (M = (a + b)/a)
6. Use magnification factor to find true S2-MFH distance (divide measured by M) (ex. 93.5)

7. Measure S2 to film (ex. 4 in) - UK*
8. Add S2 to film to actual S2-MFH (from step 6) to get true MFH to film (ex. 195.1mm)

9. Measure S2 to MFH on A-P film (ex. 10 mm) - UK*

10**. Find AP source-object by subtracting MFH to Film (step 8) from focal film distance (step 1)
11**. Use mag formula (M = (a + b) / a) to find AP mag factor where a is AP source-object (step 10) 
      and b is MFH to film (step 8)
12. Use magnifiaction factor to find true A-P offset distance from S2 to MFH (divide measured amount by mag factor) (ex. 8.9)
13. Find rotational degree by sin (theta) = opposite/hypotenuse to get rotation with S2 as axis (ex. 5.5)
    where opposite is true S2 to MFH offset distance (A-P) and hypotenuse is true S2 to MFH

14. Find rotational degree but this time use MFH as axis of rotation

Example result: 5.5 degrees with S2 as axis of rotation, 5.8 degrees with MFH as axis of rotation

*UK = unknown, needs to be inputted into program

**Explanation of step 10 and 11:
We're trying to find mag factor using M = (a+b)/a.
a is the source-object distance (tube to MFH) and b is MFH to film distance.
b was found in step 8, a is calculated by using focal film distance and subtracting b
