1. JavaFX program (for multi-platform)
2. User selects one of the situations (found in the paper)
    2a. Gives known measurements in mm/cm (identify knowns/unknowns from paper)
    2b. Program calculates unknowns
    2c. Unknowns are presented in a table
3. Host somewhere and give download link

(Optional) 
- Configurable units for measurements
- Save and load calculations


Calculations:
1. Focal film distance (ex. 72 in) - UK
2. Lateral distance S2/MFH to film (labeled as 'b') (ex. 5 in) - UK
3. Calculate source-object (labeled as 'a') (subtract 2 from 1)
4. Lateral S2 to MFH from film (ex. 100 mm) - UK
5. Calculate lateral magnifiaction factor (M = (a + b)/a)
6. Use magnification factor to find true S2-MFH distance (divide measured by M) (ex. 93.5)

7. Measure S2 to film (ex. 4 in) - UK
8. Add S2 to film to actual S2-MFH (from step 6) to get true MFH to film
9. Measure S2 to MFH on A-P film (ex. 10 mm) - UK
10. Calculate A-P source-object ('a') by adding S2 to film and true S2-MFH (from lateral) (ex. 195.1 mm)
11. Calculate A-P magnifiaction factor by using focal film distance 'b' and A-P soure-object 'a'
12. Use magnifiaction factor to find true A-P offset distance from S2 to MFH (divide measured amount by mag factor) (ex. 8.9)
13. Find rotational degree by sin (theta) = opposite/hypotenuse to get rotation with S2 as axis (ex. 5.5)

UK = unknown, needs to be inputted into program
